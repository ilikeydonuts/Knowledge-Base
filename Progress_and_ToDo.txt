
###Progress So Far:

Set up the development environment, including installing Python, a code editor, and required libraries.
Organized the PNG assets into a folder structure based on their categories (e.g., head, neck, torso, etc.).
Developed a Streamlit app following step-by-step instructions, including loading assets, creating a user-friendly GUI, previewing the character, and exporting the character as a PSD file with layers.
Implemented the "Customizable Body Part Templates" feature, allowing users to create and import their own body part templates and modify existing ones.
###TO DO:
1. The exported project files must be formatted for Krita, as they will be opened and edited in Krita instead of Photoshop.  Read up on Krita through the Krita.txt provided.
2. Find and apply the correct code for implementing it into our code, which you can find in your DCC_Python_Script.txt.  Apply the code to our existing layout and give the full, complete finished version of the code.
3. Improve the app's performance and user experience by optimizing performance, enhancing the user interface, and regularly testing the app with real users.
4. Add advanced features, such as animation support, collaboration features, and integration with external tools.
5. Test the app thoroughly on various devices and browsers.
6. Deploy the app using Streamlit Community Cloud or another suitable platform.
7. Create comprehensive documentation, including user guides, API references, and tutorials.
8. Gather user feedback and iterate on the app based on the feedback.
###
REMINDER:
Add a summary of the project's progress, including the development environment setup, asset organization, and Streamlit app implementation.
Include information on the "Customizable Body Part Templates" feature and its implementation.
Document plans for future work, including performance improvements, advanced features, testing, deployment, documentation, and user feedback.
Update the knowledge base regularly to reflect changes in the app and ensure that it remains accurate and helpful for future iterations of the project.
